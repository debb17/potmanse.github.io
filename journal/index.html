        <p>
            we all look around for a reflection, here's mine.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Every one should write, even i should, 
            Write what you want write what you need, 
            Read it , read it till you live it,
            But still you must write not for them, 
            Write it for you..
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Books,i read didn't make sense, 
            Eyes i read, didn't make sense..
            Air around didn't make me move, i was here .
            And i was no where.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A man once said " i can be terrified and still choose to carry on" and now we are all here .
            Moving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving to an infinite, of who knows where..
            But we move, 
        </p>
        <p>
            We move. Why.
            Heaven only knows. 
            Seeing from top, calling me ..
            And i say, life itself is heavenly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wish to write, write words.. 
            Saw him to be a grown man,
            All we did, 
            But could we hold it,
            Hold his pain, in our hearts.
            Found reflection in him,and now I.
            Speechless.
         </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            We all lie, isn't this the truth.
            Something must be hidden, 
            Your eyes would never see the truth,
            A just world
